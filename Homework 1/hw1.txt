From my results, average percent overlap is 32.5, and the average Spearman coefficient is -8.854238095238095.

This is because Ask and Google use different algorithms to display the results that are most relevant to the query. For example, Query 96, the percent overlap is 80.0, but the average Spearman coefficient is -0.30952380952380953, which is negative. This means Ask and Google are different in ranking the results, even high overlapping rate still indicating that the overlapping results are uncorrelated.
